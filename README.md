# PDF-Text-Extraction
In this project, I have showed three different ways we can extract information or text from our PDFs. 
I have use LangChain integrated PDFPlumberLoader and PyMUPDF and for scanned PDF pages OCR tesseract for successful textual extraction.
These extracted information can be used for various purposes accordingly for so many various products and different projects as well.
